<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
I’m Manorama, a 21-year-old B.Tech CSE student at DIT University, currently in my 3rd year with a specialization in Data Science. 
I’m from Paonta Sahib and currently living in Dehradun. I’m passionate about learning new technologies, with a strong focus on 
programming and analytics. Right now, I’m preparing for placements by studying Java DSA from Skill Risers and revising GATE subjects 
through Physics Wallah. Outside academics, I enjoy listening to Bengali music, being an active member of the Literary Club, and taking
part in community outreach activities.
